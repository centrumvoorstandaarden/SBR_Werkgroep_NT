# Use of domain/entity/industry specific labels and references

(copied from wiki, not yet checked/rewritten. Last modification on wiki 2018)
## Summary
Domain, entity and industry specific labels and references may be used by a domain that re-uses concepts from another domain. They explicitly indicate that specific terminology or references to laws and regulations for that domain.
There is no impact on usage and they are 'normal' labels and references. 

## Best practice

The SBR taxonomy supports domain, entity and industry specific labels and references. These (may) be used by a domain that re-uses concepts from another domain.
This may only be used if the semantics of the concepts remains the same, otherwise re-use would not be possible.

The xxx specific labels may be used to align descriptions of concepts with specific terminology that may differ from the original terminology.
An example (in Dutch) is the term ‘commisaris’ in the label of a VenJ concept which is referred to by OCW/DUO as ‘toezichthouder’.

Such xxxSpecific labels may be added as additional documentation, e.g. by referencing it as preferred label in a presentation linkbase to use the specific text.
Using xxxSpecific label roles instead of the standard label roles explicitly indicates that the labels are for a specific domain, entity or industry. In all other aspects they are ordinary labels.

A similar consideration holds for references. These can refer domain, entity or industry specific laws and regulations specific for that target audience.
The xxxSpecific references roles are meant to explicitly indicate they are meant as additional references as well. There is no impact on usage, just as with labels, as they are 'normal' references.
